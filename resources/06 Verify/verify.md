# Stage 6 - Verify

!!! quote ""

    You will find it a very good practice always to verify your references, sir! - *Martin Routh*

## External QA

!!! danger "A fresh set of eyes"

    Have someone who has not participated in the development of the learning materials review the final work. This will guarantee a review free of cognitive bias.

??? success "Don't forget to QA the LMS"

    The reviewer should play the role of a new learner in the LMS and check everything from the learner perspective.

??? tip "Go through the QA checklists"

    In Skills4EOSC T2.4 has developed a number of QA checklists that you and your external reviewer need to go through so that you can ensure high-quality learning materials (see [Sánchez et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8305482)).


## FAIR or not FAIR, that is the question...

    Use the [FAIR-by-Design methodology QA checklist](https://fair-by-design-methodology.github.io/FAIR-by-Design_ToT/latest/Stage%206%20%E2%80%93%20Verify/19-Final%20QA%20check/19-finalQA/#fair-by-design-methodology-qa-checklist) to check if you have followed the most important aspects of the methodology and managed to produce FAIR learning materials.

    The questions marked as essential achieve bare minimum FAIRness.

    === "Essential requirements"

        ??? abstract "Findable"

            - Is the complete learning resource (including instructors info) registered or indexed in at least one searchable repository? Is it in a FAIR repository?
            - Is metadata for the resource provided in both human- and machine-readable format (e.g JSON, XMLor YAML)?

        ??? success "Accessible"

            - Has an accessibility checker tool been utilised to improve the accessibility of all learning resource files (PDF, HTML, video, etc.)?
            - Are access rules (authentication & authorisation) implemented for the learning resource?
        
        ??? info "Interoperable"

            - Is the RDA minimal (or domain specific) metadata schema used for the learning material description?
            - Is the resource available in open file formats which are tool agnostic and compatible with a wide variety of existing software?
        
        ??? danger "Resuable"

            - Is there clear attribution for all reused resources with compatible licenses?
            - Has the learning resource been made available for use by defining a permissable license or policy information that allows derivations?
        
    === "Optional requirements"

        - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Did you follow the stages of the backward instructional design process while developing the learning resource?
        - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Are controlled vocabularies (CVs) used for describing the resource characteristics aligned with the chosen metadata schema?
        - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Does the learning resource represent a complete learning object defined around minimum one learning objective?
        - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Does the resource incorporate an instructor kit that aids in facilitating the process of others reusing learning material by offering helpful how-to guides?
            - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> facilitator guide
            - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> activities description
            - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> assessment activities and strategy to assess
            - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> general learning content or instructor notes
            - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> lesson unit plan
            - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> syllabus
        - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Have you employed a versioning system to track and control changes in your materials?
        - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Are the resource access rules (how to access, e.g. registration procedure) explicitly communicated to learners?
        - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Is the learning resource searchable in at least one relevant catalogue? 
            - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Is it FAIR (can be searched based on metadata)?
        - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Does the course include the possibility to provide feedback or comments from users and-or trainers/designers? 
            - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> If so, do you regularly gather and analyse that feedback?
        - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Does the resource adopt an open community approach regarding its quality and reachability?
        - <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> Has the learning resource been checked by a third party regarding its learning experience quality?

## Feedback QA 

!!! example "Regularly gather feedback from learners and instructors"

    Ensure that you actively and regularly gather feedback from both perspectives: the learners and the instructors.
