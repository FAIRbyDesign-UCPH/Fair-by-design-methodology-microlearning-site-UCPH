# Stage 1 - Prepare

!!! quote ""

    Before anything else, preparation is the key to success! -- *Alexander Graham Bell*

## First things first. What is FAIR?

<div class="grid" markdown>

??? note "Findable"

    The editable learning material has a unique and persistent identifier (PID) and is described with sufficiently detailed metadata.

??? success "Accessible"

    The human and machine readable metadata and object are stored in a trusted repository with clear authentication and authorization procedures.

</div>

<div class="grid" markdown>

??? warning "Interoperable"

    The metadata describing the learning material follows a the RDA minimum metadata schema combined with agreed-upon controlled vocabularies.

    Formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language(s) and format(s) are used to develop the material.

??? danger "Reusable"

    The learning material has a clear usage license (CC-BY-4.0 recommended) and accurate information on provenance.

</div>

## Adopt a metadata schema

If you are not using a discipline specific metadata schema, then, to ensure that your learning materials are appropriately described using a common approach, you should adopt the:

!!! info ""

    === "Descriptive info fields"

        - **Title** =	The human readable name of the resource.
        - **Abstract / Description** =	A brief synopsis about or description of the learning resource
        - **Author(s)** =	Name of entity(ies) authoring the resource
        - **Primary Language** =	Language in which the resource was originally published or made available
        - **Keyword(s)** =	Keywords or tags used to describe the resource
        - **Version Date** =	Version date for the most recently published or broadcast resource

    === "Access info fields"

        - **URL to Resource** =	URL that resolves to the learning resource or to a "landing page" for the resource that contains important contextual information including the direct resolvable link to the resource, if applicable.
        - **Resource URL Type**	 = Designation of the identifier scheme used for the resource URL, e.g., DOI, ARK, Handle
        - **License** =	A license document that applies to this content, typically indicated by URL
        - **Access Cost**	= Choice stating whether or not there is a fee for use of the resource (yes, no, maybe)


    === "Educational info fields"

        - **Target Group (Audience)** =	Principal users(s) for which the resource was designed
        - **Learning Resource Type** =	The predominant type or kind that characterizes the learning resource
        - **Learning Outcome** =	Descriptions of what knowledge, skills or abilities a learner should acquire on completion of the resource
        - **Expertise (Skill) Level** =	Target skill level in the topic being taught; example values include beginner, intermediate, advanced

## Define

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-flag-checkered:{ .lg .middle } __Purpose__

    ---

    When and how the learning materials can be used and for what purposes?

-   :material-target-account:{ .lg .middle } __Target Audience__

    ---

    Is there anything specific that needs to be taken into account, such as cultural context?

-   :material-history:{ .lg .middle } __Prerequisites__

    ---

    What does the target audience need to know or understand before starting the learning process?


-   :material-target-account:{ .lg .middle } __Scope__

    ---

    Is it going to be a single learning unit, or a group such as a course?

-   :material-bullseye-arrow:{ .lg .middle } __Learning Objectives__

    ---

    What competences will be gained after successful completing of the learning process?

    ??? info "Be SMART"

        Objectives should be **s**pecific, **m**easurable, **a**ttainable, **r**elevant and **t**ime-bound.

    ??? hint "Use SOLO Taxonomy"
    
        Formulate the objectives as actionable verb + observable knowledge, skill, attitude, behavior or ability and align with the appropriate SOLO level
