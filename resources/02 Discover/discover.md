## Potential for reuse

??? Danger "Respect the licenses, to be respected!"

        Materials with non-permissable licenses can be used for inspiration only. Materials with permissable licenses should be reused based on the license rules.



## Don't forget the multimedia search

Different learners have different learning modalities (read/write, auditory, visual, kinesthetic). You should use all types of multimedia in your learning materials.
